            Hello, my name is Tatiana Lujan I am 25 years old and I am starting a new career in Website Development. 
            I already have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Website design from the Arts Institute, but I wanted to extend my 
            knowledge in coding and see what else I can do. Therefore, I decided to take this coding boot camp class
            at UCR Extension campus. So far it is good we are starting off with things I know but it is always good to start from 
            the beginning so I never forget the building blocks of Web Design. 
         </p>

           Once I finish the course, my goal is to work for a big company to learn how it is working in this field, then 
           I eventually would like to start my own little company. My main goal with my little company is to help out smaller 
           companies get known. A lot of them do not know how to start when it comes to tehir website or even advertising. I also 
           want to help them with apps. But we will see what this life has in store for me after this course.
